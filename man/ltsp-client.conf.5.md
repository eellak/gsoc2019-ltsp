## NAME
**ltsp client.conf** - client configuration file for LTSP

## SYNOPSIS
Any line beginning with a '#' is considered a comment. Options are of the format:

_VARIABLE_=_value_

Do not put spaces around the "=" sign, as ltsp.conf must be shell-sourceable. All _VARIABLES_ can also be defined in the command line while running `ltsp`, for example:
```shell
BASE_DIR=/opt/ltsp ltsp-kernel
```

## DESCRIPTION
Blah blah blah
